### Gesture Recognition System

# Overview

The Gesture Recognition System is a technology-driven solution that interprets and analyzes human gestures captured through cameras. Leveraging TensorFlow, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, this system enables accurate and real-time recognition of hand movements and poses.

# Technologies Used

- TensorFlow: Empowers the development of deep learning models for gesture classification.

- MediaPipe: Facilitates precise hand tracking and pose estimation, enhancing spatial orientation understanding.

- OpenCV: Performs image processing and computer vision tasks, contributing to overall system efficiency.

- # Usage

- Cloning and entering the venv: Clone the repository, open command prompt, and open the GestureRecognition branch in your IDE. Find the path that Scripts folder exists in (should be: C:\...\ARmedEngineering\ARMEDhgr\tfod\Scripts) and change the directory in CMD to it. Then type in activate.bat to enter into the venv.
- Running the program: The venv will contain opencv, mediapipe, and other necessary modules. These modules along with Tensorflow will allow you to run the program. To run it, go up a level in the directory in CMD. Then type in python "./main.py"

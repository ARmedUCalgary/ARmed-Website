### Rendering and Visualization

This branch contains all code for Unity, rendering, and visualization of the ARmed glasses.

# Overview

This project involves developing an Augmented Reality (AR) application using Unity to display different bones and skeletons. The goal is to create a comprehensive AR experience that allows users to interact with and learn about various anatomical structures in a highly immersive environment.

# Features

- 3D Models of Bones and Skeletons: Displays high-quality models representing different bones and skeletons.
- AR Integration: Display models in an AR environment using Unity's native augmented reality support.
- Interactive Elements: Rotate, zoom, and explore models in detail.
- Educational Information: Display anatomical information about each bone and skeleton.
- User Interface: Intuitive UI for easy navigation and interaction.

# Technologies Used

- TCP: Allows communication between the Hand-Gesture-Recognition system and the Rendering and Visualization system.
- Unity: All models will be displayed and interacted with in Unity.

# Usage

Each script contains C# code for a separate function. To use a script, simply attach the script to a game object in Unity. On game start, the script will automatically execute. For the TCP script, consider attaching it to an empty game object.

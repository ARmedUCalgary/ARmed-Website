### Gesture Recognition System

# Overview

The Gesture Recognition System is a technology-driven solution that interprets and analyzes human gestures captured through cameras. Leveraging TensorFlow, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, this system enables accurate and real-time recognition of hand movements and poses.

# Technologies Used

- TensorFlow: Empowers the development of deep learning models for gesture classification.

- MediaPipe: Facilitates precise hand tracking and pose estimation, enhancing spatial orientation understanding.

- OpenCV: Performs image processing and computer vision tasks, contributing to overall system efficiency.

# Installation

- Install pip
In command prompt type in "curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py"
After that type in "python get-pip.py"

At this point in time only Mediapipe and OpenCv will need to be installed in order to run main.py

- Install Mediapipe
In command prompt type in "pip install mediapipe"

- Install OpenCV
In command prompt type in "pip install opencv-python"

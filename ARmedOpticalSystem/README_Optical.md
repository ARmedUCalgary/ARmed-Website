# Overview

This project aims to:
- develop a comprehensive simulation framework for optimizing waveguide optics in augmented reality (AR) glasses, particularly in conjunction with a microdisplay. 
- integrate computational modeling, simulation analysis, and optimization techniques, the project seeks to enhance the performance, efficiency, and functionality of the optical system.

# Objectives

- Model propogation of light through waveguide optics with microdisplays that vary in properties.
- Define key design parameters and configurations of the optical system

# Key Concepts

1. Implement algorithms to simulate light propogation
2. Design parameters (type of HOE)
3. Siulation environment (replication of real-world elements)
4. Develop optimization algorithms for iterative refinement

# Projected Benefits

- Enable design and optimiaztion of waveguide optics and microdisplay configuration for AR glasses
- Facilitate integration of simulation analysis to enhance system performance
- Optimize optical components

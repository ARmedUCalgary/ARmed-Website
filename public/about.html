								<h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
								<p>In 2023, Ferzam Mahmood and Parth Shah sat down to build a team with the aim of redefining the medical education landscape.</p>
                                <blockquote>"The idea for this club came to me when I was waiting in line outside the cadaver lab to get some extra practice before my exam. The line was comically long, and it really highlighted that being able to visualize anatomy in 3D space is far more effective than just looking at flat diagrams on paper. Unfortunately, not everyone has quick access to a cadaver when they are studying, but we saw an opportunity to bring that level of spatial understanding into the everyday learning experience. That’s what led to the creation of ARmed — an initiative focused on building augmented reality glasses that make anatomical education more intuitive and interactive."
								- Ferzam Mahmood, Club Co-Founder
								</blockquote>
								<p>From there Ferzam and Parth have grown the team to nearly 30 memebrs, through relentless innovation and a shared passion for impactful education. Each of our members bring unique skills, from software and hardware development to 3D modeling, all working together to bring our vision to life. Today, we seek to make a real difference, enhancing medical learning with frontier technology and transforming how future healthcare professionals master their craft.</p>

								<h4>Our Mission Statement</h4>
								<p>Our Mission is to design, manufacture, and program an Augmented Reality headset from scratch to visualize human anatomy and surgical simulations.</p>
								<p>We have a strong commitment to our work, always striving for Engineering Excellence, and firmly believe in the value generated by a strong team.</p>
